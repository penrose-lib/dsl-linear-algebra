This is the first draft of a dsl package page for Penrose, meaning a static
API to serve the dsl linear algebra source code.

**Changes:**

* Jekyll skeleton template and theme developed, modified from penrose.github.io
* The user can distinguish the main docs from a plugin docs by the color (purple here)
* Repository structure modified to serve a static JSON API
